Custom Content-Types
====================

The current recommended way to develop new custom content-types is by using :term:`Dexterity`. You'll find the full manual here.

Up until Plone 4.1, the standard way was to use :term:`Archetypes`. You can still develop using Archetypes, if you prefer, and they will remain available.
