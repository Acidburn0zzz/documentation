Custom Content-Types
====================

The current recommended way to develop new custom content-types is by using :doc:`Dexterity </external/plone.app.dexterity/index>`

Up until Plone 4.1, the standard way was to use :doc:`Archetypes </old-reference-manuals/archetypes/index>`. You can still develop using Archetypes, if you prefer, and they will remain available.
