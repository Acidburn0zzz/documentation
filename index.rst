============================

This document is a community maintained manual for the `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ content management system.

.. warning::

   This version is mostly for version 3.3.x of Plone, which hasn't been updated since 2011.
   It is here to help those who still run Plone 3 sites, and for those feeling nostalgic.
   We recommend to work with the current stable version of Plone.

The target audience of the documentation includes

* Content editors: writing, updating and ordering the actual content of the site

* Site administrators: installing Plone, add-ons and setting up the site

* Designers: changing Plone's visual appearance

* Deployers: hosting Plone for production on a server

* Developers: Customizing Plone, developing add-ons, and improving Plone itself
