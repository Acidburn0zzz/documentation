Installing Plone
============

For mortals
-----------

If you want to quickly evaluate and test Plone, the Unified-Installers provided of the Plone foundation, are a perfect match. It will install a lot of the required dependencies for you, the :doc:`Installation </manage/installing/installation>`-chapter in the Administration-section shows you how to do it.

For real
--------

Yes, you like it and want to use it in the real world, read :doc:`Guide to deploying and installing Plone in production </manage/deploying>` to get your portal ready for take-off.


For special species
-------------------

As a developer you likely want to have full control over the components and for that, it migh be a good idea to get familiar with buildout and the distribution of Python-modules. Yet, just as any of us, you are a mortal, too (vampires exceptioned), and we recommend to `get started </develop/plone/getstarted>` using the Unified-Installer, as well. That'll save you precious lifetime by automatically installing all the components along the way, and you can also take advantage of some bonus goodies, like the included development-helpertools. 
For the curious and a most minimal Plone-setup, you can have a look at `collective.minimalplone4 <https://github.com/collective/minimalplone4>`_, for comparison and enhancing a build step by step.
