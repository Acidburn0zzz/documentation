Installing Plone
============

For mortals
-----------

If you want to quickly evaluate and test Plone, the Plone foundation provides the Unified-Installers, which will install a lot of the required dependencies for you, the :doc:`Installation </manage/installing/installation>`-chapter in the Administration-section shows you how to do it.

For real
--------

Yes, you like it and want to use it in the real world, read :doc:`Guide to deploying and installing Plone in production </manage/deploying>` to get your portal ready for take-off.

For special species
-------------------

As a developer you likely want to have full control over the components, dive into :doc:`Buildouts are a developer's best friend </develop/plone/buildout>` to express all of omnipotence-fantasies that might be haunting you and face reality with all it's limitations bringing us down to the ground again.
